## Introduccion
Now that we know some basic R syntax, let's learn a little about RMarkdown. You will drive yourself crazy (and fail to generate a reproducible workflow!) running code directly in the console. RMarkdown is really key for collaborative research, so we're going to get started with it early and then use it for the rest of the course. 

An RMarkdown file will allow us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots.

File -> New File -> RMarkdown... -> Document of output format HTML, OK.


```{r RStudioNew, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Captura de pantalla de la interfase para la creación de un proyecto nuevo de RStudio.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/5.1_rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png")
```

You can give it a Title like "My Project". Then click OK. 

OK, first off: by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open.

Let's have a look at this file — it's not blank; there is some initial text is already provided for you. Notice a few things about it: 

- There are white and grey sections. R code is in grey sections, and other text is in white. 

```{r rmarkdown, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Imagen con el código fuente de un archivo RMarkdown.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/5.2_rmarkdown.png")
```


<br>

Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML" by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file. When you first click this button, RStudio will prompt you to save this file. Create a new folder for it somewhere that you will be able to find again (such as your Desktop or Documents), and name that folder something you'll remember (like `arctic_training_files`).

<br>

```{r rmarkdownSideSide, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Imagen con el código fuente y pagina resultante de un archivo RMarkdown.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/5.3_rmarkdown_side_by_side.png")
```


What do you notice between the two? 

Notice how the grey **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo=FALSE`.

More details...

This RMarkdown file has 2 different languages within it: **R** and **Markdown**. 

We don't know that much R yet, but you can see that we are taking a summary of some data called 'cars', and then plotting. There's a lot more to learn about R, and we'll get into it for the next few days. 

The second language is Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know. 

Notice the syntax for:

- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **bold**: `**word**`

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help > Markdown Quick Reference
<br />
<br />

**Important**: note that the hashtag `#` is used differently in Markdown and in R: 

- in R, a hashtag indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: `#` is equivalent to `######`. It's just a matter of style.
- in Markdown, a hashtag indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: `#` is a "level one header", meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. `###` is a level three header, and will show up nested below the `#` and `##` headers.

### Your Turn

1. In Markdown, Write some italic text, and make a numbered list. And add a few subheaders.
Use the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help > Markdown Quick Reference). 
1. Reknit your html file. 


### Code chunks

OK. Now let's practice with some of those commands.

Create a new chunk in your RMarkdown first in one of these ways: 

- click "Insert > R" at the top of the editor pane
- type by hand 
   \```{r}
   \```
- if you haven't deleted a chunk that came with the new file, edit that one

Now, let's write some R code. 

```
x <- 4*3
x
```

Now, hitting return does not execute this command; remember, it's just a text file. To execute it, we need to get what we typed in the the R chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways (let's do each of them):

1. copy-paste this line into the console.
1. select the line (or simply put the cursor there), and click 'Run'. This is available from 
    a. the bar above the file (green arrow)
    b. the menu bar: Code > Run Selected Line(s)
    c. keyboard shortcut: command-return
1. click the green arrow at the right of the code chunk

### Your turn

Add a few more commands to your file. Execute them by trying the three ways above. Then, save your R Markdown file. 


## R functions, help pages

So far we've learned some of the basic syntax and concepts of R programming, how to navigate RStudio, and RMarkdown, but we haven't done any complicated or interesting programming processes yet. This is where functions come in!

A function is a way to group a set of commands together to undertake a task in a reusable way. When a function is executed, it produces a return value. We often say that we are "calling" a function when it is executed. Functions can be user defined and saved to an object using the assignment operator, so you can write whatever functions you need, but R also has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions ready to use. To start, we will be using some built in R functions.

All functions are called using the same syntax: function name with parentheses around what the function needs in order to do what it was built to do. The pieces of information that the function needs to do its job are called arguments. So the syntax will look something like: `result_value <- function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)`. 

### A simple example

To take a very simple example, let's look at the `mean()` function. As you might expect, this is a function that will take the mean of a set of numbers. Very convenient!

Let's create our vector of weights again:

```{r}
peso_kg <- c(55, 25, 12)
```

and use the `mean` function to calculate the mean weight.

```{r}
mean(peso_kg)
```

### Getting help

What if you know the name of the function that you want to use, but don't know exactly how to use it? Thankfully RStudio provides an easy way to access the help documentation for functions.

To access the help page for `mean`, enter the following into your console:

```{r, eval = F}
?mean
```

The help pane will show up in the lower right hand corner of your RStudio.

The help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function(s) and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.


### Your turn

> Exercise: Talk to your neighbor(s) and look up the help file for a function that you know or expect to exist. Here are some ideas: `?getwd()`, `?plot()`,  `min()`, `max()`, `?log()`).

And there's also help for when you only sort of remember the function name: double-questionmark:
```{r, eval=F}
??install 
```

Not all functions have (or require) arguments:
```{r}
date()
```

### Use a function to read a file into R

So far we have learned how to assign values to objects in R, and what a function is, but we haven't quite put it all together yet with real data yet. To do this, we will introduce the function `read.csv`, which will be in the first lines of many of your future scripts. It does exactly what it says, it reads in a csv file to R.

Since this is our irst time using this function, first access the help page for `read.csv`. This has a lot of information in it, as this function has a lot of arguments, and the first one is especially important - we have to tell it what file to look for. Let's get a file!

#### Download a file from the Arctic Data Center

Navigate to this dataset by Craig Tweedie that is published on the Arctic Data Center. [Craig Tweedie. 2009. North Pole Environmental Observatory Bottle Chemistry. Arctic Data Center. doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X.](http://doi.org/10.18739/A25T3FZ8X), and download the first csv file called "BGchem2008data.csv"

Move this file from your Downloads folder into a place you can more easily find it. I recommend creating a folder called `data` in your previously-created directory `arctic_training_files`, and putting the file there.

Now we have to tell `read.csv` how to find the file. We do this using the `file` argument which you can see in usage section in the help page. In RMarkdown, you can either use absolute paths (which will start with your home directory `~/`) or paths **relative to the location of the RMarkdown.** RStudio and RMarkdown have some great autocomplete capabilities when using relative paths, so we will go that route. Assuming you have moved your file to a folder within `arctic_training_files` called `data`, your `read.csv` call will look like this:

```{r, eval = F}
bg_chem <- read.csv("data/BGchem2008data.csv")
```

You should now have an object of the class `data.frame` in your environment called `bg_chem`. Check your environment pane to ensure this is true.

Note that in the help page there are a whole bunch of arguments that we didn't use in the call above. Some of the arguments in function calls are optional, and some are required. Optional arguments will be shown in the usage section with a `name = value` pair, with the default value shown. If you do not specify a `name = value` pair for that argument in your function call, the function will assume the default value (example: `header = TRUE` for `read.csv`). Required arguments will only show the name of the argument, without a value. Note that the only required argument for `read.csv` is `file`.

You can always specify arguments in `name = value` form. But if you do not, R attempts to resolve by position. So above, it is assumed that we want `file = "data/BGchem2008data.csv"`, since file is the first argument. If we wanted to add another argument, say `stringsAsFactors`, we need to specify it explicitly using the `name = value` pair, since the second argument is `header`. For functions I call often, I use this resolve by position for the first argument or maybe the first two. After that, I always use `name = value`.

Many R users (including myself) will override the default `stringsAsFactors` argument using the following call:

```{r}
bg_chem <- read.csv("data/BGchem2008data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```



## Using `data.frames`

A `data.frame` is a two dimensional data structure in R that mimics spreadsheet behavior. It is a collection of rows and columns of data, where each column has a name and represents a variable, and each row represents a measurement of that variable. When we ran `read.csv`, the object `bg_chem` that we created is a `data.frame`. There are a a bunch of ways R and RStudio help you explore data frames. Here are a few, give them each a try:

- click on the word `bg_chem` in the environment pane
- click on the arrow next to `bg_chem` in the environment pane
- execute `head(bg_chem)` in the console
- execute `View(bg_chem)` in the console

Usually we will want to run functions on individual columns in a `data.frame`. To call a specific column, we use the list subset operator `$`. Say you want to look at the first few rows of the `Date` column only. This would do the trick:

```{r}
head(bg_chem$Date)
```

How about calculating the mean temperature of all the CTD samples?

```{r}
mean(bg_chem$CTD_Temperature)
```

Or, if we want to save this to a variable to use later:

```{r}
mean_temp <- mean(bg_chem$CTD_Temperature)
```

You can also create basic plots using the list subset operator.

```{r}
plot(bg_chem$CTD_Depth, bg_chem$CTD_Temperature)
```

There are many more advancted tools and functions in R that will enable you to make better plots using cleaner syntax, we will cover some of these later in the course. 

### Your Turn

> Exercise: Spend a few minutes exploring this dataset. Try out different functions on columns using the list subset operator and experiment with different plots. 

## Troubleshooting

### My RMarkdown won't knit to PDF

If you get an error when trying to knit to PDF that says your computer doesn't have a LaTeX installation, one of two things is likely happening:

1. Your computer doesn't have LaTeX installed
2. You have an installation of LaTeX but RStudio cannot find it (it is not on the path)

If you already use LaTeX (like to write papers), you fall in the second category. Solving this requires directing RStudio to your installation - and isn't covered here.

If you fall in the first category - you are sure you don't have LaTeX installed - can use the R package `tinytex` to easily get an installation recognized by RStudio, as long as you have administrative rights to your computer.

To install `tinytex` run:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

If you get an error that looks like `destination /usr/local/bin not writable`, you need to give yourself permission to write to this directory (again, only possible if you have administrative rights). To do this, run this command in the terminal:


    sudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/bin

and then try the above install instructions again. More information about `tinytex` can be found [here](https://yihui.name/tinytex/)

### I just entered a command and nothing is happening

It may be because you didn't complete a command: is there a little `+` in your console? R is saying that it is waiting for you to finish. In the example below, I need to close that parenthesis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
> x <- seq(1, 10
+ 
```

You can either just type the closing parentheses here and push return, or push the `esc` button twice.

### R says my object is not found

New users will frequently see errors that look like this: `Error in mean(myobject) : object 'myobject' not found`

This means that you do not have an object called `myobject` saved in your environment. The common reasons for this are:

- **typeo**: make sure your object name is spelled exactly like what shows up in the console. Remember R is case sensitive.
- **not writing to a variable**: note that the object is only saved in the environment if you use the assignment operator, eg: `myobject <- read.csv(...)`
- **not executing the line in your RMarkdown**: remember that writing a line of code in RMarkdown is not the same as writing in the console, you have to execute the line of code using command + enter, running the chunk, or one of the other ways outlined in the RMarkdown section of this training

## Literate Analysis

RMarkdown is an excellent way to generate literate analysis, and a reproducible workflow. [Here](https://nceas.github.io/sasap-training/materials/reproducible_research_in_r_fairbanks/example-brood-table-analysis.html) is an example of a real analysis workflow written using RMarkdown.
